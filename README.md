I am taking online specialization to cover concepts and tools needed throughout the data science course. It will allow me to apply the skills learned by building a data product using real-world data. At completion, I will have a portfolio demonstrating my mastery of the material and have a fundamental understanding of the field and be prepared to continue study data science.
